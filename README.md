# Week 1

1. Implemented a paper named [Detection of Diabetes Using Multilayer Perceptron: Proceedings of ICICA 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saumendra-Mohapatra/publication/327545512_Detection_of_Diabetes_Using_Multilayer_Perceptron_Proceedings_of_ICICA_2018/links/5cdd2644458515712eae0a3e/Detection-of-Diabetes-Using-Multilayer-Perceptron-Proceedings-of-ICICA-2018.pdf). In this paper,  Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Network is used for classification of pregnant women. Proposed technique has been applied on the diabetes database of PIMA for Indian people and is collected from University of California (UCI).

2. Implemented a basic feed-forward network and classify 64*64 chest x-ray to detect Pneumonia.

3. Implemented a basic feed-forward networkThis dataset is for the classification of healthy and bleached corals. The [Healthy and Bleached Corals Image Classification Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/healthy-and-bleached-corals-image-classification) contains a total of 923 images collected from Flickr using the Flickr API. These images are categorized into two distinct classes: healthy corals (438 images) and bleached corals (485 images).
