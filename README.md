# Week 1: Neural Networks Fundamentals

Learned how to create a neural network

#### 1. Implemented a Research Paper:

Worked on the paper [Detection of Diabetes Using Multilayer Perceptron: Proceedings of ICICA 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saumendra-Mohapatra/publication/327545512_Detection_of_Diabetes_Using_Multilayer_Perceptron_Proceedings_of_ICICA_2018/links/5cdd2644458515712eae0a3e/Detection-of-Diabetes-Using-Multilayer-Perceptron-Proceedings-of-ICICA-2018.pdf). The MLP network was applied to classify pregnant women using the PIMA diabetes dataset from UCI.

#### 2. Chest X-ray Classification:

Developed a basic feed-forward neural network to classify 64x64 chest X-ray images for Pneumonia detection.

#### 3. Coral Image Classification:
Built a feed-forward network to classify healthy vs bleached corals using the [Healthy and Bleached Corals Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/healthy-and-bleached-corals-image-classification). The dataset contains 923 images: 438 healthy and 485 bleached corals.


# Week 2: Convolutional Neural Networks

#### 1. Implemented CNN on Alzheimer MRI Dataset:
Worked with the Alzheimer MRI Preprocessed Dataset to build a CNN model for early detection.

#### 2. Model Architectures:
Explored and built architectures of GoogleNet and ResNet.

#### 3. Transfer Learning & Data Augmentation:
Utilized transfer learning to improve performance and applied data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.

# Week 3: Handling Data Imbalance & Sequential Data

#### 1. Data Imbalance:
Learned techniques to handle data imbalance problems, improving model accuracy on underrepresented classes.

#### 2. LSTM Implementation:
Implemented an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network for sequential data handling.

# Week 4: Advanced Model Training

#### 1. Overfitting & Underfitting:
Studied how to mitigate overfitting and underfitting to improve model generalization.

#### 2. WaveNet Implementation:
Explored generative audio models by implementing WaveNet.

#### 3. Advanced Computer Vision:
Gained insights into classification, object detection, and segmentation techniques.

# Week 5: Object Detection

#### YOLO (You Only Look Once):
Mastered the use of YOLO for real-time object detection tasks.
